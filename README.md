# Spooky-Author-Identification
The notebook on famous Kaggle competition : Spooky Author Identification.  The task is to identify the authors from their respective texts or work. I have first cleaned and pre-processed the text using  standard NLP techniques like tokenization , stemming or lemmatization , stop-word removal etc.... I have also tried to create some meta features or hand-crafted features based on the author writing pattern. Then I have used the traditional BOW approach with TFIDF Vectorizer and the Count Vectorizer and then deployed ML algos like LogisticRegression and Naive Bayes which are well suited for text data. For me tfidf on count vectorizer gave best results till now ; My submission scored a multi-class log loss of 0.46 on kaggle private LB which is quite decent.
